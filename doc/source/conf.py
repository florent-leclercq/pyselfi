# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# Insert the project root dir as the first element in the PYTHONPATH.
# This lets us ensure that the source package is imported, and that its
# version is used.
