pySELFI makes it possible to include new statistical models, including in particular new (Gaussian) priors and new methods for the core architecture (such as prior optimization, described in |citepLeclercqetal2019|_).

The code for new statistical models can go into new python modules, placed for example in a subdirectory of ``src/pyselfi/`` such as ``src/pyselfi/power_spectrum/``, which is provided within the code.

Adding a new prior can be done by defining a new class :class:`prior`. This class shall have a method :meth:`compute` (not taking any argument except **self**). The only requirement is that after :meth:`compute` has been called by the pySELFI core infrastructure, three attributes have been defined (by the constructor, by methods called by :meth:`compute`, or by :meth:`compute` itself):

* :obj:`self.mean`: an array of size :math:`S` giving the prior mean (recall that in the SELFI algorithm, the prior mean shall also be the expansion point :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}_0`, so consistency is required here),
* :obj:`self.covariance`: an array of size :math:`S \times S` giving the prior covariance matrix :math:`\textbf{S}`,
* :obj:`self.inv_covariance`: an array of size :math:`S \times S` giving the prior inverse covariance matrix :math:`\textbf{S}^{-1}`,

The :class:`prior` class shall also have a method :meth:`save` (with arguments **self, fname**) and a class method :meth:`load` (with arguments **cls, fname**) to save to and load prior data from the pySELFI hdf5 output file (in particular the three mandatory attributes, see above). Instances of the new :class:`prior` class can then be used to define and manipulate :obj:`selfi` objects, as described in `this page <../gettingstarted/basic_usage.html>`__. Working examples of :class:`prior` classes can be found in ``src/pyselfi/power_spectrum/prior.py`` and ``src/pyselfi/lotkavolterra/prior.py``.

Adding new features to pySELFI can simply be done by defining a child of the :class:`selfi` class and using it instead of the parent class. Working examples of child :class:`selfi` classes can be found in ``src/pyselfi/power_spectrum/selfi.py`` and ``src/pyselfi/lotkavolterra/selfi.py``.
